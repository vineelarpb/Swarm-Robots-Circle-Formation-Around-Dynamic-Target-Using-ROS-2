## Abstract

This project thoroughly studies image synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using CIFAR-10 dataset as the benchmark. GAN architecture trained with a discriminator and generator together, augmented with Wasserstein loss and gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for improved stability and convergence. Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) as evaluation metrics, indicating the quality and diversity of generated images. With an FID score of 12.06 and an IS score of 1.0, the generated images closely resemble real CIFAR-10 samples. This project underscores the proficiency of GANs in image synthesis, mainly in conjunction with WGAN-GP. Our findings contribute to advancing and providing valuable insights for future research in this domain.
